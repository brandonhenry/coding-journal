## Update - 12/16/2020

What started 5 years ago as something to hold my project ideas over the years was sadly neglected. However, today I can proudly say I have graduated with my Software Engineering degree and have done several projects over the years including working at a fortune 500 company and helping shape the future of our countries defense systems by working at Camgian. I hope to update this Git over the coming months to provide all of the experience that I have gained and what I've gone through and plan to go through.
