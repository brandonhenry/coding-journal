So this will be sort of like my coding jounral for online purposes. Later on down the line I will create a 
website/blog and post these posts there as well, however for now, I will stick to this.

Today I have begun to look into the necessary requirements for my degree. I am majoring in Software Engineering and
as of today, I attend East Mississippi Community College. There are many reasons I am here now instead of MSU,
but those reasons do not matter anymore.

I have prior knowledge in HTML, VB.NET, Javascript, and Python. Everything I have created up to this point(which is a lot)
has ultimately been lost on previous harddrives or not appropiate for uploading. That is why I am starting fresh and
recording all my coding and progress in a professional manner. I will try and keep everything I do updated and posted
from here on out. 

I have always been quite enthusiatic about coding. I remember when I was about 10 years old, I coded my first game. I 
enjoyed computers and games so I thought, hey, why not make a game. So I downloaded Blender and started learning Python
and at the end of it all, the only thing I got out of it was some cool blender techniques and some half baked coding.

From that point on I've enjoyed what I could do with coding. Being able to take what you learned and apply it to literally
anything you could think of is just great! I like building, creating, molding things. Being able to take what my 
imagination conjures up and making it reality is really the most wonderful experience ever. That is why I want to
learn to code. I want to learn it all from basics to the advanced techniques. Why? Because I know once I am done,
I will be able to make anything. The possibilities are endless.
